        <h1> A Long Way From Aleppo:  </h1>
				<h2> A Doctor and His Family Try to Rebuild Their Lives in Hoover After Fleeing the Ravages of War</h2>
        <p> Tom Gordon, for BirminghamWatch and B-Metro Magazine, April 2, 2017
				<br> It has been a warm day in early August 2012, in Aleppo, the historic, cosmopolitan Syrian city where you work and live. This day is part of the Muslim month of Ramadan, in which the faithful fast from sunup to sunset. Now the sun is setting, and your oldest son, Fouad, and two of your daughters, Rama and Lydia, are out in the walled garden of your elegant, 14-room home getting ready for iftar, the meal that will break the day’s fast..</p>

          <h2> ABOUT MY FAMILY'S LIFE</h2>
          <p>
						<dl>
						<P>Before the month is out, you, Latifa, Lydia, your other son, Khaldoun, and your baby daughter, Caroline will have left your bloodied, battered country. By September, Fouad will have left and Rama will have joined relatives, among them your mother and father, who have fled to Turkey.

Your name is Ahmad Faris, you are now 52 years old, and you used to be a well-off, well-known and well-respected surgeon. Now you and your family are among the approximately 5 million Syrians who have left Syria since the civil war’s start in 2011, and you hope that one day, you will practice medicine again.</P>

<P>In the meantime, you, Latifa, Khaldoun, Rama, Lydia and Caroline are now making your home in a place where, on the August day that brought the terror of war over the rooftop of your home in Aleppo, young, high-school-age men are getting ready to don helmets and shoulder pads and practice a war-like game that you still do not fully understand.

This place is Hoover, Alabama.

Since 2011, the plight of Syrians fleeing their shattered homeland has been in the news repeatedly. We’ve seen desperate families on decrepit boats in the Mediterranean – more than 80,000 Syrians, nearly the population of Hoover, crossed that sea last year. We’ve seen images of crying children outside rows of United Nations-furnished tents in refugee camps in Turkey or Jordan, or faces pressed against border barriers in eastern Europe.

We’ve also seen desperate faces, wounded bodies and battered buildings during the recent fighting in Aleppo, as forces loyal to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad used barrel bombs and other lethal weapons to drive forces opposed to Assad’s regime from the eastern half of the city. The recent fighting has killed or displaced thousands. But the overall ranks of the displaced also include those who left in 2012 when things were starting to fall apart.

Some of them were physicians, like Faris, and he was not the last to go. By November 2015, most of Aleppo’s doctors had “either fled, been detained, or killed, many as a direct result of the incessant barrel bomb attacks,” according to Physicians for Human Rights.</P>
